# ChangeCalculator
Small console app to calculate change from a purchase

Solution should be plug and play to build and run in Visual Studio. When running through Visual Studio, the target directory will NOT contain the Money.xml file by default. 
The app currently lacks error handling, so make sure you follow the instructions on the screen. 

There is also a folder containing a single exe that is runnable on its own, this folder also contains an example Money.xml file, which can be used to specify the currency.
